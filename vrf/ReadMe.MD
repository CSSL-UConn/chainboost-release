The VRF module is brought from [Algorand](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand)
and more specifically from the implemented VRF located in the following branch:
<https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/tree/1504f5f39ec2893d2b0ac9b60d1b87f6e7d4e2fc/crypto>

All Algorand users execute crypto-graphic sortition to determine if they are selected to propose a block in a given round.


In ByzcoinX: RandHound leader is selected by the VRF-based leader election
in Algorand: Election of the committee is private and totally random (via the VRF based technique combined with proof of stake).
